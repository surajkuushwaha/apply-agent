Dear Tailor Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Full-Stack Software Engineer position at Tailor. Your mission to replace rigid ERP systems with adaptive, composable infrastructure resonates deeply with my experience building flexible, API-first platforms for B2B SaaS companies.

**Why I'm a strong fit:**

Over the past 4+ years at CultureX Entertainment, I've done exactly what this role demands—translating messy, real-world business requirements into elegant, maintainable systems:

- **Productizing Solutions at Scale:** I owned the end-to-end lifecycle of a public-facing microservice, transforming internal tooling into a high-availability API product. This mirrors your need to "productize repeatable solutions into scalable modules."

- **Customer-Centric Engineering:** I've shipped 10+ MVPs for an influencer marketing platform, collaborating across teams to balance rapid feature delivery with clean, long-term abstractions—the same pragmatic, outcome-biased approach you're looking for.

- **Technical Alignment:** My daily stack includes TypeScript, Node.js, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL. I've architected event-driven systems using AWS (EventBridge, SQS, Lambda) handling 10M+ monthly requests with high reliability.

- **Comfortable with Ambiguity:** I led a strategic migration from multi-database silos to a unified SaaS architecture for 30+ global brands—a project that required decomposing fuzzy requirements, prioritizing independently, and shipping without a complete spec.

**Why Tailor:**

I'm drawn to Headless ERP because I've seen firsthand how rigid systems slow down growing businesses. The opportunity to work directly with customers, understand their operational pain points, and turn them into smart software is exactly the kind of high-impact work I thrive on.

I'm remote-native, fluent in async communication, and available for overlap with US West timezone.

Looking forward to discussing how I can contribute to Tailor's growth.

Best regards,
Suraj Kushwaha
